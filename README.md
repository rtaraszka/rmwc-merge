## About UXPin Merge

Merge is a revolutionary technology that lets users import (and keep in sync) coded React.js components from GIT repositories to UXPin editor. 
The imported components are 100% identical to components used by developers during the development process. 
It means that components are going to look and, function (interactions, data) identical to the real product experienced by the users. 

[UXPin](http://uxpin.com) is a leading code–based design platform.

## How to use Merge integration with RMWC?

Merge is currently only available to selected beta users.

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your computer.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Log in to your UXPin beta account (approved for alpha and beta tests by UXPin Inc.)
